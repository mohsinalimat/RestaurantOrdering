# RestaurantOrdering

This was an old project of mine, did it over a year or two ago. I just wanted to opensource it for fun.

This code can be used to allow the waiters to take the order via a smartphone and/or allow the customers to do it themselves. A QR Code may be placed on the table denoting the url for the same.

Setting up is pretty easy, just upload all the files and import the sql files.

The admin panel can be accessed from url/admin. The default username is admin and the password is iambatman007. This can be changed by editing the index.php file in /admin.

Best wishes.
