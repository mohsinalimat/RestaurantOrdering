# RestaurantOrdering

This was an old project of mine, did it over a year or two ago. I just wanted to opensource it for fun.

This code can be used to allow the waiters to take the order via a smartphone and/or allow the customers to do it themselves. A QR Code may be placed on the table denoting the url for the same.

Setting up is pretty easy, just upload all the files and import the sql files.
